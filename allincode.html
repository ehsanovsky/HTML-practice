<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<p>HTML links are defined with the a tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:</p>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
<img src="img_typo.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

<p>If we try to display an image that does not exist, the value of the alt attribute will be displayed instead. </p>

<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
<h2 title="I'm a header">The title Attribute</h2>

<p title="I'm a tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>

<p title=About W3Schools>
You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value
if the value contains spaces.
</p>

<p><b>
If you move the mouse over the paragraph above,
your browser will only display the first word from the title.
</b></p>

<h2>Single or Double Quotes?</h2>
<p>In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:</p>
<p>Move your mouse over the paragraphs below to see the effect:</p>

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>John with double quotes</p>
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">John with single quotes</p>

<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

<p>You can change the size of a heading with the style attribute, using the font-size property.</p>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr><hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

<p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>

<pre>

   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
